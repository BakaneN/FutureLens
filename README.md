FUTURE LENS
See your future, one career at a time

1.	Introduction
FutureLens was born out of countless conversations with young people who felt uncertain, overwhelmed, or lost when it came to figuring out how to reach their career goals. Many of them had dreams but lacked clear direction, guidance, or access to reliable resources that could help them take the next step. I recognized a real need for something practical—something that could break down complex career paths into simple, bite-sized, and achievable steps. 

That’s exactly what FutureLens aims to do. It’s more than just a platform; it’s a tool to help users visualize their journey, gain confidence, and take ownership of their future. This project is deeply personal to me, and building it has been both a passion and a purpose. It also represents a significant milestone in my learning journey, proudly forming part of my ALX Software Engineering Portfolio.
